# Blog Jahin Project

#### initial notes

- Database - it can be separate, like separate connection with your project code
    - sql/mysql, postgres, mongodb, sqlite (query language - query (read/get/search/insert/delete/update))

- when in server ( for our local settings it is (apache server) which we are using came with xampp/wampp) any php project runs, then the project root folder when opened - it will search for index.html or index.php

- mysqli_real_escape_string, sql injection

- Sir's suggestions to use - cookie, ajax, server, session, mvc


####

- for later: 
    - categories while creating posts
    - role based update/delete
    - for each file convert into raw php mysql
